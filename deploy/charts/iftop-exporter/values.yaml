  # selectors:
  # - selector1Name:label1key,label2key==some-value
  # - selector2Name:label3key!=some-value,label4key==some-value
  #
  # Note:
  # 1. For each selector, the selectorName is MUST,
  #    the selectorName is colon-separated (`:`) with the label selections,
  #    the label selections are comma-separated (`,`).
  # 2. In each selector, the label selections are logical AND-ed, which means that
  #    all label selections MUST be all matched, then the selector is matched.
  #    For label selection,
  #    - Only "=", "==", "!=" are valid labelOperators. "=" and "==" have same result.
  #      - If label-value is omitted, it would be set to empty string.
  #      - If label-operator (and label-value) is omitted, it means to check the existence of the label key.
  # 3. Different selectors are logical OR-ed (selector1 or selector2), which means that
  #    any one selector is matched, the Pod is selected.
